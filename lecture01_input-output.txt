input/output

input scanner

types of scanners
(about 4)

scanner methods
(about 8)

tricky scanner stuff
scanner.next();
this doesn't take off new line character
scanner.nextLine();
takes off new line character

scanner delimiters
scanner.useDelimiter(","); 
scans until it his a comma, then prints everything up until there. 
good for comma separated lists.

Printf
let's you print data in a template
system.out.printf("%d %.2f", num1, float1);
%d = integer
%s = 
%f = floats
%.2f lets you round to 2 decimal places

Strings

strings are immutable - once it's created, it can't be changed. you have to construct a new string. 

problem:
create a method called aLotOfAs, that takes in a number N, and returns a string with N "a"s. For example aLotOfAs...

string concatination

big O (N)
run code and N get's things added to it 

solution:
big O(N^2)
big o n squared

StringBuilder class

string vs string builder

fixed solution:
public String aLotOfAs(int N) {
StringBuilder temp = new StringBuilder();
for(int i = 0; i<N; i++) {
temp.append("a");
}
return temp.toString();
}
...

*there's more modification freedom with C because of the char primitive data type. so you can make a char array*
